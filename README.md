Nyay Sahayak is an empathetic AI legal guide that helps citizens navigate the critical first steps after facing crimes or legal disputes. By interpreting a user’s real-world situation in natural language, the system identifies the type of case, retrieves verified legal knowledge (IPC sections & procedures), and generates a personalized legal action roadmap including FIR guidance, evidence handling, and safety steps. Built using RAG, vector embeddings, and an LLM for contextual response generation.
